All the gains are the same. Choose \texttt{Act} as the splitting attribute. For the forth layer at \texttt{Color} = Blue, \texttt{Size} = Large, \texttt{Act} = Dip, all the labels are Ts. Thus, the label of this node is set as T. For the forth layer at \texttt{Color} = Blue, \texttt{Size} = Large, \texttt{Act} = Stretch. Choose the only attribute, \texttt{Age}, as the splitting attribute. The label of the node \texttt{Age} = Adult is F and the other is T. For the forth layer at \texttt{Color} = Red, \texttt{Size} = Large, \texttt{Act} = Dip, all the labels are Ts. Thus, the label of this node is set as T. For the forth layer at \texttt{Color} = Red, \texttt{Size} = Large, \texttt{Act} = Stretch. Choose the only attribute, \texttt{Age}, as the splitting attribute. The label of the node \texttt{Age} = Adult is F and the other is T. For the forth layer at \texttt{Color} = Red, \texttt{Size} = Small, \texttt{Act} = Dip, all the labels are Ts. Thus, the label of this node is set as T. For the forth layer at \texttt{Color} = Red, \texttt{Size} = Small, \texttt{Act} = Stretch. Choose the only attribute, \texttt{Age}, as the splitting attribute. The label of the node \texttt{Age} = Adult is F and the other is T. Thus, The decision tree:
